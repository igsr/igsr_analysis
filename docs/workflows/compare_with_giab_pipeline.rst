Benchmarking with GIAB
===================

This workflow is used in our project to benchmark the sites identified in our call sets for sample NA12878 with the sites identified by the Genome in a Bottle consortium [https://github.com/genome-in-a-bottle]. 
This consortium was created to produce reference data sets that can be used for genome comparison and benchmarking and the high-confidence sites identified by this consortium for sample NA12878 are the result 
of an effort to integrate the data generated by 13 different sequencing technologies and analysis methods.
