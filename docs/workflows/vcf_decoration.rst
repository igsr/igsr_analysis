VCF decoration
==============

This workflow is used in IGSR for annotating/validating the VCF files produced in our project.
More specifically the pipeline will take the phased VCF generated after running the `PyHive::PipeConfig::Shapeit.pm <https://github.com/igsr/igsr_analysis/blob/master/PyHive/PipeConfig/INTEGRATION/Shapeit.pm>`_ pipeline 
and will add the following annotations:

* Allele frequency for a particular variant
* Alelle frequency in the different populations analyzed
* Total number of alternate alleles in called genotypes
* Total number of alleles in called genotypes
* Number of samples with data
* Information on whether a variant is
  within the exon pull down target boundaries
* Approximate read depth

Additionally, the workflow will also check if the VCF is in a valid format

Dependencies
------------

* Nextflow
 This pipeline uses a workflow management system named Nextflow. This software can be downloaded from:

 https://www.nextflow.io/

* Tabix and bgzip
 Tabix and bgzip are part of the HTSlib project, which can be downloaded from:

 https://github.com/samtools/htslib

* BCFTools
 Downloadable from:

 http://www.htslib.org/download/

* BEDTools
 Downloadable from:

 https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2/releases/

* vcf-validator
 This tool can be obtained from:

 https://github.com/EBIvariation/vcf-validator

* IGSR-analysis code base
 The scripts needed to run this workflow can be downloaded by cloning the IGSR-analysis github repo from:

 https://github.com/igsr/igsr_analysis.git

How to run the pipeline
-----------------------

* First, you need to create a ``nexflow.config`` file that can be used by Nextflow to set the required variables. Here goes an example of one of these files::

	params.sample_panel='/homes/ernesto/lib/igsr_analysis_master/igsr_analysis/SUPPORTING/integrated_allsamples.20180619.superpopulations.panel'
	params.pops='EAS,EUR,AFR,AMR,SAS' // comma separated list of populations or superpopulations that will be used for the annotation
	params.exome='/nfs/production/reseq-info/work/ernesto/isgr/VARIANT_CALLING/VARCALL_ALLGENOME_13022017/COMBINING/ANNOTATION/output_1000G_Exome.v1.ensembl.bed' // path to .BED file with coordinates of the exomes
	params.tabix='/nfs/production/reseq-info/work/ernesto/bin/anaconda3/bin/tabix' // path to tabix binary
	params.igsr_root='/nfs/production/reseq-info/work/ernesto/isgr/SCRATCH/17_09_2018/lib/igsr_analysis/' // folder containing the igsr codebase downloaded from https://github.com/igsr/igsr_analysis.git
	params.vcf_validator='/nfs/production/reseq-info/work/ernesto/bin/vcf_validator/vcf_validator_linux' // path to vcf_validator binary

* Then, you can start your pipeline by doing::

	nextflow run $IGSR_CODEBASE/scripts/VCF/ANNOTATION/decorate.nf --phased_vcf chr20.unannotated.phased.vcf.gz --ann_vcf chr20.ann.unphased.vcf.gz --region 20:1-64444167

 Where:
  * ``$IGSR_CODEBASE`` is the folder containing the igsr codebase downloaded from ``https://github.com/igsr/igsr_analysis.git``
  * ``--phased_vcf`` is the phased VCF generated after running the `PyHive::PipeConfig::INTERGRATION::Shapeit.pm <https://github.com/igsr/igsr_analysis/blob/master/PyHive/PipeConfig/INTEGRATION/Shapeit.pm>`_ pipeline that will be decorated in this workflow
  * ``--ann_vcf`` is the unphased VCF generated by the `PyHive::PipeConfig::INTEGRATION::VCFIntegrationGATKUG.pm <https://github.com/igsr/igsr_analysis/blob/master/PyHive/PipeConfig/INTEGRATION/VCFIntegrationGATKUG.pm>`_ pipeline which will contain the 'INFO/DP' (depth) annotation for each particular site
  * ``--region`` is the region that will be analyzed

Pipeline output
---------------

This worklow will create a folder name ``results/`` with 2 output files:

* ``chr20.GRCh38.phased.vcf.gz`` 

 That will be the final annotated VCF
* ``chr20.vcf.validation.txt``

 Will contain the output of the ``vcf-validator``
