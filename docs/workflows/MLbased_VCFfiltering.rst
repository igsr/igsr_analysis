ML-based workflow to filter a VCF
=================================

Filtering the spurious variants from a callset is a common task in variation studies using sequencing data.

Variant discovery methods are not perfect and will produce a certain number of false positive calls, specially if the sequencing data is either noisy or the depth of coverage is not enough to distinguish a real variant from a sequencing artifact.

This is why a method for identifying these false variants is necessary. Different methods have been developed for filtering and at the time of writing I would say that the most used is `GATK VQSR <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20644199>`_ which works really well and is specially relevant for filtering the calls obtained with the GATK callers (UnifiedGenotyper [UG] and HaplotypeCaller [HC]).

VQSR relies on a sophisticated model that needs to be trained with the annotation profiles generated by UG or HC for the different variant sites and will also depend on the existence of reference datasets specially formatted in order to be used with VQSR.

The problem arises when you need to filter a callset obtained from a non-GATK caller and do not have the variant annotations required by VQSR or you are analysing variation data from a non-human organism for which there is not a VQSR-formatted reference call set.

If you find yourself in this situation you might find this pipeline useful.
