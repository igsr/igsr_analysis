Welcome to the igsr_analysis documentation!
=========================================
This is the documentation showing how to use the code and how to run the different pipelines we use for the analysis of IGSR data. 

The International Genome Sample Resource (IGSR) is a project funded by the Wellcome Trust created after the finalization of the 1000 Genomes Project in order to maintain and expand the resource. It has the following aims:

* Ensure the future access to and usability of the 1000 Genomes reference data
* Incorporate additional published genomic data on the 1000 Genomes samples
* Expand the data collection to include new populations not represented in the 1000 Genomes Project
