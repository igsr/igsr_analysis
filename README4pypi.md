This package contains code that is relevant for the analysis (Mapping, BAM qc, Variant Calling, Filtering etc...) of IGSR data 

The International Genome Sample Resource [(IGSR)](http://www.internationalgenome.org/) is a project funded by the [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.ac.uk/) created after the finalization of the 1000 Genomes Project in order to maintain and expand the resource. It has the following aims:

* Ensure the future access to and usability of the 1000 Genomes reference data
* Incorporate additional published genomic data on the 1000 Genomes samples
* Expand the data collection to include new populations not represented in the 1000 Genomes Project 

This package contains code used in the different analyses pipelines that we use in the project.
